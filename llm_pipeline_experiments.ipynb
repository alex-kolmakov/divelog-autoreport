In July 2010, he is mounting his eighth expedition to search for the still-missing Bonhomme Richard . \\u201cIf I find the Bonhomme Richard ,\\u201d says Cussler, \\u201cI\\u2019ll die a happy man.\\u201d It\\u2019s apparent that even at age 78, Clive Cussler is still a world-class adventurer. Saving the Hunley The CSS H.L. Hunley , Cussler\\u2019s most rewarding shipwreck discovery, is housed at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in Charleston, S.C., for further study and conservation. \\u00a9 Alert Diver \\u2014 Q3 Summer 2010\",\n          \"Between July and October at a few deep and current-swept sites off Bali\\u2019s satellite islands, thousands of divers seek encounters with one of the oddest fish in the sea: the ocean sunfish, or mola . Although the ocean sunfish is related to the pufferfish, boxfish and triggerfish, it is like no other. It lacks a swim bladder, having instead an incompressible, gelatinous, subcutaneous tissue that can make up as much as 44 percent of its mass. This tissue along with the animal\\u2019s skin, which can be up to 8 inches thick in larger molas, render it neutrally buoyant at any depth. The sunfish is the most fecund fish in the ocean; one 4-foot-long female was found to have 300 million eggs in its ovaries. By the time an egg becomes a full adult, the fish will have increased in weight 60 million times. Although many English speakers refer to it as a sunfish, it\\u2019s known in some other European languages as a moonfish. Its family name, Molidae, and genus name, Mola , are derived from the Latin word for millstone, as its physique is reminiscent of a large disc. But it looks much more like a swimming head with a conspicuously tall dorsal fin, a long anal fin and no discernable tail. A pseudotail, called a clavus, functions more or less as a rudder, but all the swimming power comes from the synchronized beating of its two large fins. The fins are even powerful enough to enable the sunfish to breach the water\\u2019s surface and briefly launch itself into the air \\u2014 no mean feat for the largest bony fish in the sea. Bali has several seasonal sites at which divers can encounter molas that come to be cleaned of parasites. The dives are often deep and current-swept, so these encounters are best suited to advanced divers. In addition to an unusual shape, sunfish have large eyes and large, puckered mouths, which they are physically unable to close completely. Their bizarre appearance and great size (they can measure more than 10 feet from fin tip to fin tip) and the fact that they\\u2019re not\",\n          \"As a divemaster for the past four decades, my travels have included scuba and snorkel trips to all of the world\\u2019s major oceans. Twenty-five years ago I co-founded Zegrahm Expeditions, a leader in adventure travel to the most remote islands on the planet. The goal of our work has been to help explorers fully experience the world rather than simply tour it. As part of ensuring our travelers have access to the best care, we have always required divers to carry DAN\\u00ae dive accident insurance. Before my trip to Madagascar this was, to me, an abstract precaution. Prior to an expedition across the Tropical Eastern Pacific last year, I went into the emergency room near my home in Key Largo, Fla., complaining of chest pain. They monitored me for two days but found no irregularities in my electrocardiogram (EKG) or blood work. I was released with the understanding that my problem might just be heartburn. Grove is pictured with some of the clinic staff who helped him during his ordeal. Before a recent expedition in the Western Indian Ocean, however, the story was different. I was diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction \\u2014 a heart attack. To say I was shocked is an understatement. The change in my diagnosis from heartburn to heart attack was confirmed when I flew to the Seychelles to board a small expedition vessel for a trip through the remote southern atolls of the Seychelles to Zanzibar and the Comoros islands. Experiencing chest pain once again, I went to the ship\\u2019s doctor, who this time discovered an irregularity in my EKG. The doctor sent me to a clinic \\u2014 a very modern one \\u2014 in Antsiranana (formerly Diego Suarez), a port city at the northern tip of Madagascar. There a doctor determined the level of troponin in my blood was elevated, which confirmed my heart was in danger and that I was already having a heart attack. I had a hard time believing it because the discomfort was minimal. My expectations of what a heart attack was were upended, and it was then that I called\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"_dlt_load_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1726060651.0296018\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"_dlt_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7499,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"aDh9N2V/CfheNw\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Most individuals who enjoy watersports have held their breath underwater at some point, but most do so without formal training or awareness of the known dangers despite the ready availability of this lifesaving information. When practiced safely, however, breath-hold diving can be an exhilarating experience. With the rise in freediving\\u2019s popularity across many different water sports comes large numbers of beginners who are seeking formal training. Such training offers attainable physical and mental goals with many benefits for mental and physical health and enhanced self-esteem. It also requires strict adherence to safeguards. Disregarding safety measures can bring serious risks to your lungs and brain and even result in death. Understanding the known risks and taking action to mitigate them are central to successfully enjoying any activity, and freediving is no exception. Formal training from a certified freediving instructor, which various training agencies offer, provides the basic foundations of freediving safety. The instructor will emphasize many vital concepts during your training. Two of the most important and often repeated tenets are to never breath-hold dive alone and to avoid hyperventilating before diving. Once certified, you\\u2019ll know how to incorporate strict safety standards into every dive, no matter how trivial they may seem. The dive briefing, which should happen before every breath-hold dive, will include analyzing risks, addressing specific concerns regarding the planned dives, and reviewing breath control, rescue techniques, and resuscitation. Breath control is a critical point that some freedivers overlook, but it directly affects your body\\u2019s oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Breathing is an autonomic function of the human body and can reflect internal changes in the body\\u2019s state. Carbon dioxide is a powerful stimulant for breathing \\u2014 our urge\",\n          \"Ensure that divers with asthma undergo both an assessment of lung function and an exercise test to determine asthma severity. When performing a diver assessment, ask these questions: Is the asthma mild? Is the treatment working sufficiently to prevent an acute asthma attack while underwater or on the surface? If the treatment regimen can return the pulmonary function test results to normal, especially following exercise, the individual may be fit to dive and perform strenuous exercise, which may be necessary while diving. A doctor knowledgeable in both diving and treating asthma might be able to offer the best medical advice.\",\n          \"to find a promising dig site and search for teeth, no one wants to go home with an empty mesh bag after investing the time, money and effort. That singular focus may carry a high cost. Divers and crew alike have observed that feverish tooth hunters may neglect to follow a dive plan, disregard gear checks, leave equipment behind, forget to monitor gauges and ignore the use of the buddy system in their quest. As with any underwater pursuit, divers must weigh the value of the hunt for teeth against their own health and safety. As part of risk reduction, we must examine factors that contributed to deaths and injuries and use that information to improve safety. We do so not as criticism of those who were injured or who died, but so that some meaning and betterment can be taken from their tragedies. A review of recent fatality and injury cases of North Carolina coastal divers by members of the U.S. Coast Guard, professional dive instructors and the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner identified multiple safety risk factors that all divers should consider, whether hunting for fossilized teeth or pursuing other underwater activities. Have a Dive Plan A diver focused on the goal of a dive may neglect the dive itself and with it the protocols for gear preparation and checks. Documented findings revealed divers leaving behind alternate air cylinders on the boat deck, when a backup air source would have meant a lifesaving option for an out-of-air emergency. Rushing to enter the water without proper gear checks increases the risk of an underwater emergency due to gear malfunction or lack of appropriate equipment. Having a well-established dive plan is a critical component of recreational and technical diving taught at all levels of dive certification.

      "checks. Slow down! Conduct equipment checks, and follow your dive plan. Those teeth have been there for millions of years. They can wait a few more minutes. While it can be a challenging dive, taking appropriate safety precautions such as thorough gear checks, buddy diving, proper equipment use and diligent monitoring of your dive profile and air consumption can help reduce the chance of an incident. Solo Diving Divers hunting for teeth seem to prefer operating alone as they fan the seafloor or blow it with scooter wash. If a diver experiences an out-of-air emergency while solo diving, there are no nearby divers or resources to assist and provide critical air for survival. Without an alternate air source, an out-of-air situation at more than 100 fsw requires the diver to ditch weights, drop bags of rocks and teeth and make an emergency ascent without additional air. This dangerous scenario increases the risk of drowning, arterial gas embolism and decompression sickness. An added risk for Meg Ledge divers is that they are often heavily weighted to stay on the bottom while searching for teeth. The Coast Guard recently identified divers at the Meg Ledge often deliberately carrying out solo diving activities without possessing the applicable solo technical dive certifications and experience. Meg Ledge divers often descend to the seafloor and spread out in different directions to search for teeth. The distances may vary, but it is not uncommon to be 30 to 50 feet from the next nearest diver and have no visibility of their location. Using wreck reel lines as breadcrumbs to find their way back to the anchor line, the divers purposefully separated themselves significant distances, abandoning the buddy system they were trained to use and disconnecting their lifeline to the only source of assistance during an underwater emergency. This unsafe practice is common for Meg Ledge divers but contradicts diver certification instruction. Keeping a buddy a few feet away won’t prevent\n",
      "bronchodilators and oral steroids is required as is use of short-acting bronchodilators during acute episodes. If the treatment regimen can return the pulmonary function test results to normal, especially following exercise, people with asthma may be able to safely dive (and perform the strenuous exercise that may be required during diving). Complications The treatment of asthma is relevant in determining its severity and the associated risk of diving. According to discussions among experts at the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS), divers who have mild intermittent asthma, mild persistent asthma or moderate persistent asthma, may be allowed to dive, provided their asthma is well controlled. Implications in Diving For the Diver Countries have differing guidelines about whether people with asthma can dive. In the United Kingdom, people whose asthma is well controlled may dive provided they have not needed a bronchodilator within 48 hours and they do not have cold-, exercise- or emotion-induced asthma. In Australia, the most conservative country in this respect, all divers are expected to pass a spirometry (lung function) test to rule out asthma prior to certification. Check with your country’s guidelines prior to diving. Prospective divers with asthma should undergo both an assessment of lung function and an exercise test to gauge asthma severity. A physician knowledgeable in diving as well as the treatment of asthma might be in a position to offer the best advice. Keep your inhaler with you and ready to use on the dive boat. Alert the dive operator of your inhaler and any potential complications. For the Dive Operator Divers with asthma should be under a physician’s care and be able to tell you that their condition is under control and without complications. Divers should keep their inhalers on the boat and ready to use in the event of an attack.

      "An inflator suddenly fires air into the BCD, causing a diver to ascend rapidly. Reported Story A diver was completing an easy and uneventful 18 m (60 ft) dive when all of a sudden, the BCD air injector triggered without manual activation, causing a rapid, uncontrolled ascent to the surface. Since the rapid ascent was apparently inconsequential, the diver switched gear and continued with her day of diving without any problems. The next day she reported a mild headache, but it resolved favorably without intervention. Comment Problems with equipment seem to be a relatively rare occurrence, but can happen to any diver. Good maintenance is the key to avoid surprises during a dive that could put the diver at risk. Proper buoyancy control is a fundamental skill to ensure dive safety. Effective training would have ensured that well assimilated safety procedures were followed – like pushing the deflator button to avoid an uncontrolled rapid ascent. A rapid ascent could be a life threatening incident, triggering anything from decompression sickness to a lung over expansion injury and even an arterial gas embolism. Sergio Viegas, DAN Brasil\n",

      "IMAGINE RENTING A CAR, NAVIGATING TRAFFIC ON UNFAMILIAR ROADS, and then finding yourself in a heavy rainstorm — only to realize you don’t know how to operate the windshield wipers. You would not want to replicate this situation underwater with dive gear. Whatever equipment you use to dive, you need to know how to operate it before you submerge. If you have your own gear, comfort with it comes naturally over time. When renting scuba gear, however, you may not have much time to familiarize yourself with it before diving. Fortunately, you can do some things to ensure you start the dive comfortable and confident with the equipment you will be using. When renting a dive computer, ensure you know how to read it — where to find the depth, time, no-decompression limit, remaining gas, etc. Make sure you know the meaning of the typical beeps or vibrations that will occur throughout a normal dive. If you use a gas other than air, be sure you know how to set the breathing-gas mix on the computer. Some computers hold the settings from the last dive, so even if you are on air you will want to check this setting. If the computer is air-integrated, check that it is paired to the transmitter on your regulator. If it isn’t paired correctly, it might display information from someone else’s cylinder. The BCD should appear well cared for and fit you properly. Confirm that you can put it on and take it off without looking at the releases and be able to find the low-pressure inflator hose by feel. You should also be able to disconnect it from the power inflator without difficulty. Review whether the setup is weight-integrated or uses a weight belt, and make sure that both you and your buddy know how to release your weights in an emergency. Regulators should be clean and well maintained. Without connecting the regulator to a cylinder, try to take a breath out of each of the second stages.

Having a good understanding of your baseline weighting needs and the factors influencing your buoyancy will aid you in adjusting to a variety of environments and conditions. How to Perform a Buoyancy Check Start in water too deep to stand in, and release all the air from your BC. Inhale a normal breath, and the water should be at eye level. When you exhale, you should sink so that the water is just over your head and then rise to eye level as you inhale normally again. Adjust your weights in small increments (e.g., two pounds at a time). Consider adding a little extra weight to offset the potentially positive buoyancy of a partially emptied aluminum cylinder at the end of the dive. If you are properly weighted, you should be able to hover effortlessly at 15 feet at the end of your dive with 500 psi in your aluminum tank and no air in your BC. © Alert Diver — Q4 Fall 2014\n",

      "Based on your provided dive data, there are a few areas that could benefit from attention. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Rapid Ascent: With 4 instances where your ascent rate exceeded 10m per minute, you are ascending too rapidly, which increases your risk of decompression sickness (DCS). DAN recommends a slow, steady ascent, generally no faster than 9m/min in the first 15m of ascent, and slowing to 3m/min in the final 3m of ascent. Uncontrolled rapid ascents can trigger anything from decompression sickness to a lung overexpansion injury and even an arterial gas embolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Close NDL (No Decompression Limit): You mentioned reaching 2 minutes on your NDL. Divers should aim to avoid pushing NDLs to the limit. Nearing the no-decompression limit can increase the risk of Decompression Sickness (DCS) due to supersaturation, making off gassing slower.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Depth Variance: A variance greater than 10m suggests a zig-zagging dive profile. This repeated up and down can increase DCS risk due to variations in pressure causing slower off gassing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. SAC (Surface Air Consumption) Rate: Your SAC rate of 23 means you are consuming a relatively large amount of air, suggesting either strenuous exercise or stress. DAN recommends divers to avoid strenuous exercise during the dive to reduce air consumption and lower DCS risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take steps to address these areas by planning your dives more carefully, maintaining a steady ascent rate, managing your air supply effectively, and monitoring your depth regularly. Remember, dive safety comes first.\n"
